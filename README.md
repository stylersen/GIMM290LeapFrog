First Push: I made this game with raycasts shooting upwards from each player. When an object with either the tag Player1 or Player2 touches the other players raycast, a point is awarded to them. I adjusted the move speed and rotation speed of each player to make the game faster and more fluid. Thats all for this push

Second Push: Added UI that displays the score of each player. Had to use the legacy UI because textmeshpro wasnt working. It works perfectly now. Made the text bigger. The game also ends when one player reaches ten points. Thats all for this one

Third push: Made the points system more complex and the game more fun. A player can score two or even three points depending on how high up they are when they hit the raycast of the other player. The player that gets scored on also gets frozen for seconds equal to the amount of points scored on them.
